### Hi there! I'm Etore!

## About Me

I'm a *Data* and *Software Engineer* with experience in **Earth Science Data Handling**, **Satellite Data Manipulation**, **Non-structured Data Processing** and more...
Since 10, I'm trying to understand how to improve my coding style. Sometimes it works well, sometimes is better than expected! 

Sometime in the Past, I worked as an **Earth Engine Specialist**, and I had the chance to present my work about deforestation detection at the Google's California Head Quarter!

And, after that, I worked on Satellite Data processing, from the raw ingestion to image delivering in a Public Service in Brazil.
